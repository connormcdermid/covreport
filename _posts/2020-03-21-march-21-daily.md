Hello, everyone! I'm your host, Connor McDermid. Let's get right to it.

Yesterday was a somewhat slow day, but let's take a look at the numbers.

------------------------INFECTION REPORTS NJ-----------------------------  
AS OF 12:48 PM on March 21, (20200321T1248, 1584809364 epoch), there are:  

890 confirmed cases of COVID-19  
11 deaths as a result of COVID-19  
0 serious cases  
0 recoveries  

MORRIS COUNTY:  

See previous.

COMMENTS:  

You'll notice that the number above hasn't actually changed since yesterday, and for a very good reason.  

New Jersey has run out of tests. The first major testing centre was opened Friday in Bergen County and ran out of
tests after just 4 hours of operation.  

-------------------------INFECTION REPORTS US----------------------------  

19,459 confirmed cases of COVID-19  
263 deaths  
60 serious cases  
26 recovered  


------------------------GLOBAL INFECTION REPORTS-------------------------  

287,379 confirmed cases  
11,951 deaths  
8,077 serious  
92,592 recoveries  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  

That's all for today. Have a nice weekend, and stay healthy.
