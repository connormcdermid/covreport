Hello, everyone! Welcome to another Coronavirus Report! This'll be incredibly depressing, so let's just get it over with, shall we?

--------------------------INFECTION REPORTS NJ----------------------------  
AS OF 3:00 PM on March 22, (20200322T1500, 1584903647 epoch), there are

1,917 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey  
20 deaths as a direct result of COVID-19  
0 serious cases  
0 recoveries  

I have ceased tracking cases on a per-county basis as the disease moves so fast that the numbers are out-of-date as soon as they're published.


--------------------------INFECTION REPORTS US----------------------------  
AS OF 3:00 PM on March 22, (20200322T1500, 1584903647 epoch), there are  

38,792 confirmed cases  
401 deaths  
61 serious    
186 recoveries  
   

-------------------------GLOBAL INFECTION REPORTS-------------------------  

342,907 confirmed cases  
14,686 deaths  
8,615 serious cases  
97,955 recoveries  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------  

That's all for today. Stay healthy, although I admit that's getting harder every day.
