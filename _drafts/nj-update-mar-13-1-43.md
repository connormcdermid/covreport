## UPDATE FOR MAR 13 1:43

I'm your host, Connor McDermid, and this is a Coronavirus Update.

New Jersey has published updated infection numbers as of 1:43, Mar. 13.

There are now 31 cases in the state, with new ones appearing in Hoboken[^1] and Jersey City[^2].

The school closure list has also been updated, with the Morris County School of Technology being added to the list, among others. You can view the entire list [here](https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/03/coronavirus-closures-latest-nj-school-closings-map-of-outbreak-friday-march-13.html)

There have been 270 complaints of price gouging in New Jersey alone as businesses seek to profit off of the panic.[^3] Please be cautions of purchasing products that claim to be designed specifically to target coronavirus, as no such products have in fact been developed.

In other news, stocks continue to plummet today as the coronavirus panic seizes the nation. The Dow Industrial Average, S&P 500, and FTSE 100 both suffered the worst drop since 1987 yesterday, and projections continue to predict further drops as trade is stifled by new regulations and traders panic even more.
